// Low-level Snap execution primitives.
// These handle switching context into a Snap and returning from it.
//
// The runner executes Snaps without using any system calls, hence it uses
// no-syscalls variants of the UContext manipulation functions. The following
// are not switched between contexts:
//   - segment bases fs_base and gs_base
//   - signal masks
//
// In addition, fs_base and gs_base are almost always reset to zero by
// RestoreUContextNoSyscall.
//
// We could end a Snap via an exceptions, which causes the exact register
// state at the exit to be captured but exceptions are slow due to two required
// context switches in and out of the kernel.  Instead of using exceptions,
// Snaps end by calling to a pre-defined address that leads back to the
// runner. This is faster than using exceptions. The runner inspects stack
// contents of the Snapshot to figure out the actual end point address.
// RunnerReentry() below needs to fix up the stack to include the address after
// Snap exit sequence in the memory end state.
//
// TODO(dougkwan): [as-needed] For RISC architectures, function calls usually
// do not write return addesses in memory but in registers. We need to fix up
// differently on RISC CPUs. The exit sequence on a RISC CPU probably requires
// saving return register first and then calling the exit location.
//
// Thread safety note: Except when denoted otherwise, all functions in this file
// are not thread-safe as these manipulate global state without locking.
