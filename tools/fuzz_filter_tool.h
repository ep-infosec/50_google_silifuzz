// A SimpleFixTool is a tool the integrates the fixer pipeline, the corpus
// partitioner and relocatable corpus building. Currently, it takes a corpus
// consisting of raw instruction sequences from Centipede, converts these into
// snapshots with undefined end states, runs the Snap maker to make Snapshots
// complete, partitions snapshots into shards and creates a relocatable corpus.
// As everything is done in memory, there is a limit on of corpus size. The
// limit may change in the future if we implement streaming for intermediate
// results in and out of a file system.
